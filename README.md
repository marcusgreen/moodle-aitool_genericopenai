# Generic OpenAI Tool

## Overview
The Generic OpenAI Tool is a plugin for the local_ai_manager from https://github.com/bycs-lp/moodle-local_ai_manager. It is a clone of the chatgpt tool except the endpoint and model can be customised.
This means it can work with any service that implements the OpenAI standard.
